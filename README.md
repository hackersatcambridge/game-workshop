# How to Make a Game in 45 Minutes
The repository that accompanies the Hackers at Cambridge: Make a Game in 45 Minutes workshop

You need [GameMaker Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) to open and run
the project.

The following game was made in 45 minutes in a workshop at the Computer Lab at
the University of Cambridge.

You can find the slides to the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOVtJX9o5jUf5vI0UNhKSvo-ZifTfpspXx5_Knn2erI/edit?usp=sharing).
